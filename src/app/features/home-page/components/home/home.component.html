      What started as an <span>academy project</span> at InMind has evolved into something 
      much more meaningful. As a passionate <span>computer science student</span>, 
      I've always wanted to create my own e-commerce platform. This project became 
      the perfect opportunity to lay the foundation for <span>4EVER TEEN</span>, 
      my upcoming clothing brand. While this version showcases my technical skills 
      and creative vision, it's just the beginning. Soon, 4EVER TEEN will launch 
      as a full-fledged store, bringing you unique fashion pieces that celebrate 
      youth and style. Stay tuned as we transform this academic project into 
      a real-world shopping experience.
